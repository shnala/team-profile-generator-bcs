## Description

Welcome to Team Profile Generator! This easy-to-use app will allow you to generate a tidy website that showcases your list of employees and their contact information. It runs in the command line and takes input from the user via a series of prompts. Using this app makes it easy to create a hub of information containing all of your employees' contact info, laid out in a nice and easy-to-read fashion. No longer will one have to sort through long, eyesore lists of dense text to find that hidden email or office number. Use this app to make your life better, faster, more efficient and ultimately, more professional.


## Installation

As this is a command line app, there are a couple of steps required to get it going. Please refer to my video below for a quick walkthrough on how to install the app:

## Usage

Using the app is as simple as answering the prompts given in the command line. Initialize the app by entering 'node index.js' into the terminal. The prompts will appear and then you just need to type in your answers to the prompts and hit 'enter.' To navigate through your choices, use the arrow keys, and hit 'enter' to make your selection.
